pyW215
======

pyW215 is a python3 library for interfacing with the d-link W215 Smart
Plug.

The library is largely inspired by the javascript implementation by
@bikerp `dsp-w215-hnap`_.

Installing
==========
Install using the PyPI index

.. code:: bash

  pip install pyW215

Usage
=====

.. code:: python

   #!python3
   from pyW215.pyW215 import SmartPlug, ON, OFF

   sp = SmartPlug('192.168.1.110', '******')
   # Where ****** is the "code pin" printed on the setup card

   # Get values if available otherwise return N/A
   print(sp.current_consumption)
   print(sp.temperature)
   print(sp.total_consumption)

   # Turn switch on and off
   sp.state = ON
   sp.state = OFF

Note: You need to know the IP and password of your device. The password is written on the side.
